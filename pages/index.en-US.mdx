  The L2 for public good maxis
</div>

In a world where public goods funding is not abundant and bountiful, many organizations who believe in the importance of public goods are often looking for novel ways to fund them. After years of [raising and deploying capital based on community sentiment](https://www.gitcoin.co/about), an alliance of public good maxis led by Gitcoin has the solution.

Enter, PGN.

The Public Goods Network (PGN) is a new L2 specifically designed to support public goods. It has the same fast, cost-efficient, and scalable features that come with an L2, but with the added benefit of collecting funding for your favorite public goods projects.
