# Adding PGN to a Wallet

PGN is currently built into Metamask and Rabby Wallet. 

While the instructions on this page describe how to add PGN to [Metamask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC), the same network details in the table can be used for other wallet providers, such as [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/wallet/How-to-add-custom-networks-Coinbase-Wallet#:~:text=Navigate%20to%20Active%20Dapp%20Network,the%20fields%20and%20select%20Save.).

1. Start by opening your wallet and navigating to the network menu. 
2. Click on the "Add network" button in this menu. You'll then be taken to a screen where you can search for common networks.
3. Click on the “Add a network manually” button. You'll be taken to a new screen with a form for adding a network.
4. Fill out this form with the network information listed at the bottom of this page:
5. Click the “Save” button to finish adding PGN to your wallet.
