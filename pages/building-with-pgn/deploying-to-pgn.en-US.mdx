# Deploying contracts

## Available development stacks

Since PGN is built with [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), you can utilize one of the following development stacks. We don’t currently have a strong recommendation on which one you use.

| Development stack                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Configuring your development stack

Make sure to configure these tools with the correct chain ID and RPC URL to deploy smart contracts to PGN’s mainnet and testnet. See our [network and contract details](/network-and-contract-details) page for more information.

## Request for contributions

If you are interested in contributing to PGN, we’d love to include more specific tutorials that show how to set up, verify, and deploy dApps using these different development stacks.

Please feel free to contribute via our docs [GitHub](https://github.com/supermodularxyz/pgn-docs/pages/building-with-pgn/deploying-to-pgn.mdx), which is linked to from the “Edit this page” button on the right side of this page.
