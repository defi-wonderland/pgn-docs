1. Join the [Telegram community](https://t.me/+9_ZHRaz7nmJkMTIx) if you're interested in building on PGN and helping us set up core infrastructure on the protocol.
2. If you are interested in deploying on PGN, or joining the [Alliance](/faq#what-is-the-public-goods-alliance), please reach out to pgn@gitcoin.co.

We also encourage you to provide feedback or make contributions to our developer docs in GitHub.

### Contributing to Internationalizing Our Documentation

Contributing to the internationalization of our documentation is a rewarding way to support our project and enhance its accessibility. We follow the "docs-as-code" model, which treats documentation as code, making it easier for both developers and non-developers to contribute. Here's a simple set of steps you can take to make an open-source contribution to our internationalization efforts:

#### Step 1

First off, you should be making contributions to this [documentation repository](https://github.com/supermodularxyz/pgn-docs) on GitHub.

#### Step 2

Once you've opened a new branch, you will need to make updates the following updates before translating any content:

In `next.config.js`, please add the language code of the language you are working with to `i18n` > `locales`. 

Example: 

```js filename="next.config.js" {7-10}
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.tsx'
})
 
module.exports = withNextra({
  i18n: {
    locales: ['en', 'zh', 'de'],
    defaultLocale: 'en'
  }
})
```

In `theme.config.jsx`, please make sure to add your language under `i18n`to configure the language dropdown.

Example: 

```js filename="theme.config.jsx"
i18n: [
  { locale: 'en', text: 'English' },
  { locale: 'zh', text: '中文' },
  { locale: 'de', text: 'Deutsch' },
  { locale: 'ar', text: 'العربية', direction: 'rtl' }
]
```

#### Step 3

Next, you will duplicate all the files that you intend on translating and change the file name to have the locale codes as your file extension.

Example:

```plaintext
/pages
  _meta.en.json
  _meta.zh.json
  _meta.de.json
  index.en.md
  index.zh.md
  index.de.md
  ...
```

#### Step 4. 

Translate the content into the chosen language.

#### Step 5

Create a pull request to submit the translated pages to the team for review. 

#### Step 6

Check back periodically to see what changes have been made to the docs so you can help adjust the translated pages.
